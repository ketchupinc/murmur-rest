## Murmur-rest API v1

### Overview

Murmur-REST is a RESTful web application wrapper over the Murmur SLICE API to administer virtual Mumble servers. The API allows you to develop your own application using the feature set and endpoints provided. This project was built to administer Mumble servers for [Guildbit.com](http://guildbit.com). 

Murmur-REST is still in early development. If you find any issues or would like to help contribute to the project, please report them via Github issues or send a pull request.

### Development Setup

Assuming you already have Murmur running and set up, follow the instructions below to run murmur-rest
for development. Tested on Ubuntu 13.10, but should be to run wherever Murmur and Zero Ice are supported.

Runserver.py uses Flask's development server. This should be used for development only. See 
Deployment for Production for running in production mode. Python virtualenv is highly recommended as well.

1) Install required Zero Ice library

`sudo apt-get install python-zeroc-ice`

2) Clone and install murmur-rest

```
git clone git@github.com:alfg/murmur-rest.git
cd /directory/to/murmur-rest
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note*: If running in virtualenv, use the `--system-site-packages` flag in order to import the Ice library.

3) Run and test application

```
$ cp settings.py.example settings.py
$ python runserver.py
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/
 * Restarting with reloader
 
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/servers/
[
    {
        "address": ":::64739",
        "channels": 1,
        "humanize_uptime": "0:00:02",
        "id": 2,
        "log_length": 35,
        "maxusers": "10",
        "name": "",
        "running": true,
        "uptime": 2,
        "users": 0
    }
]
```


### Docker Setup

A Dockerfile is provided to easily setup a local development setup. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and run the following commands:

* Build the image:
```
cd /path/to/murmur-rest
docker build -t murmur-rest .
```

This will build the image and pull in all dependencies to run the application, including murmur.

* Run container:
```
docker run -p 5000:5000 -t -i murmur-rest
```

* Load `http://{VM IP}:5000/servers/` into the browser to test.
If you're unsure what your Docker VM's host is, just run `docker-machine ls` to check.



###  Deployment for Production

Following the same steps for Deployment for Development, just use a Python WSGI application server
such as [Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/) instead of the built-in Flask server. The provided `wsgi.py`
file is provided for this.

For example, if using Gunicorn and virtualenv:

```
/path/to/murmur-rest/env/bin/gunicorn -b 127.0.0.1:5000 wsgi:app
```

### Notes

- Early development. Expect changes that might break the first revision of the RESTful API
- API is incomplete and will be completed over time
- I'm following the RESTful API specification and standards as closely as I can (with some exceptions), please feel
free to suggest any corrections
- Murmur SLICE API is located here: http://mumble.sourceforge.net/slice/Murmur.html

### TODO

- Complete support for full Murmur SLICE API
- Easier deployment for production
- Documentation
- Error Handling
